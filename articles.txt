Why People Watch YouTube Videos at Faster Playback Speeds
-------------
 According to a YouTube blog post, most people watch videos at the 
 normal speed (1x).

However, more users are increasingly changing the speed, 
speeding things up "more than 85 percent of the time." This is 
what YouTube has to say about it:

Apart from normal, 1.5x is used the most often, followed by 2x as 
a close second and 1.25x at third. And for the perfectionists who 
like custom speeds, 1.1x was the most used speed. Just a little faster, 
but not too much! YouTube users saved an average of over 900 years
of video time per day when watching at faster speeds. That would be like 
watching PSY’s “Gangnam Style” nearly 113 million times.

BlackByte Ransomware Abuses Legitimate Drivers to Disable Security Measures
-------------------
 BlackByte Ransomware Used to Bypass Security Layers

BlackByte ransomware has been in use since 2021 and acts as a ransomware-as-a-service organization. 
These groups offer ransomware products to other malicious actors for a fee. BlackByte is now back in
 the spotlight after being used in a tactic known as "Bring Your Own Driver". In this attack, 
 cybercriminals are exploiting a vulnerability within the RTCore64.sys Windows graphics overclocking
  utility driver known as CVE-2021-16098.

A Bring Your Own Driver attack involves installing a vulnerable version of the
 RTCore64.sys driver onto a victim's device. The attacker can then abuse this flawed 
 driver while also staying under the radar of security software.

The new threat was discovered by Sophos, a well-known cybersecurity firm. In a 
Sophos News post, it was stated that the CVE-2021-16098 vulnerability "allows an authenticated 
user to read and write to arbitrary memory, which could be exploited for privilege escalation,
 code execution under high privileges, or information disclosure".
