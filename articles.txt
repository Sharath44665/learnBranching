Why People Watch YouTube Videos at Faster Playback Speeds
-------------
 According to a YouTube blog post, most people watch videos at the 
 normal speed (1x).

However, more users are increasingly changing the speed, 
speeding things up "more than 85 percent of the time." This is 
what YouTube has to say about it:

Apart from normal, 1.5x is used the most often, followed by 2x as 
a close second and 1.25x at third. And for the perfectionists who 
like custom speeds, 1.1x was the most used speed. Just a little faster, 
but not too much! YouTube users saved an average of over 900 years
of video time per day when watching at faster speeds. That would be like 
watching PSY’s “Gangnam Style” nearly 113 million times.
